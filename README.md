# C++ Programming Exercises

This repository contains C++ exercises I completed while learning the language.  
I've organised the exercises by chapters, and cover fundamental programming concepts.

## 📁 Structure

- `chapter01/` – Expressions, input and assignment
- `chapter02/` – Conditional statements  
- `chapter03/` – Loops: for, while, do-while  
- `chapter04/` – Arrays
- `chapter05/` – Struct
- `chapter06/` – Functions and scope
- `chapter07/` – Pointers - without dynamic memory allocation
- `chapter08/` – Pointers - with dynamic memory allocation
- `chapter09/` – Vectors
- `chapter10/` – List

## 🎯 Purpose

These exercises reflect my self-study journey of C++, and serve as a foundation as I want to transition into a more technical career path such as data engineering or software development.

Why starting with C++? 
I've chosen to learn C++ because of its low-level capabilities, which offer more transparency into how memory allocation, pointers, and performance optimization really work under the hood. Unlike higher-level languages like Python that abstract away many details, C++ exposes these mechanisms directly. By building this foundational knowledge, I aim to develop a deeper technical understanding that will not only improve my skills as a programmer but also give me an advantage when learning other languages and working on performance-critical applications.
